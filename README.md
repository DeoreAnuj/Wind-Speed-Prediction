# Wind-Speed-Prediction
Created Project On Google Colab 
Wind Speed Prediction

This repository contains a project on Wind Speed Prediction, developed during Edunet Training. The project was implemented using Google Colab, leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and predict wind speed based on historical data.

Project Overview
	•	Developed as part of Edunet Training.
	•	Implemented in Google Colab for seamless execution and collaboration.
	•	Focuses on predicting wind speed using machine learning algorithms.
	•	Utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to achieve accurate predictions.

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Google Colab
	•	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
	•	Scikit-learn (for machine learning modeling
